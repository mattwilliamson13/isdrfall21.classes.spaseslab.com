I will try to respond to all course-related e-mails and Slack messages within 48 hours (please allow additional time if you send your message during the weekend).\n \nCourse Description Spatial data are ubiquitous and form the basis for many of our inquiries into social, ecological, and evolutionary processes. As such, developing the skills necessary for incorporating spatial data into reproducible statistical workflows is critical. In this course, we will introduce the core components of manipulating spatial data within the R statistical environment including managing vector and raster data, projections, extraction of data values, interpolation, and plotting. Students will also learn to prototype and benchmark different workflows to aid in applying the appropriate tools to their research questions.\n Course Objectives Students completing this course should be able to:\n Develop reproducible workflows for manipulating, visualizing, and analyzing spatial data. Understand the unique components of spatial data and how those components fit in R‚Äôs data structures. Articulate the different formats of spatial data and identify which R packages are suited to each type. Describe why space matters for many social and ecological questions Implement a variety of descriptive and statistical spatial analyses. Leverage functional programming to automate and expedite spatial data operations.   Important pep talk! I promise you can succeed in this class.\nLearning R can be difficult at first‚Äîit‚Äôs like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham‚Äîthe chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you‚Äôll be using like ggplot2‚Äîmade this wise observation:\n It‚Äôs easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs me, I‚Äôm really stupid,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not made out to program.‚Äù But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It‚Äôs just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don‚Äôt blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later. Even experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you‚Äôre finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, e-mail me, etc.\n  Expectations Seminar courses like these are only successful if we all work together. Shared expectations are a big part of that. As such, I expect the following from you:\nParticipation - I expect you to show up, ask questions, work through the in-class coding exercises, and be generally present while we are together.\n Understanding - We are all at different places in our research and our experience with scientific computing. Rather than belittle each other for not knowing how to do something, I hope to create an environment where we all learn from each other and there are no stupid questions. I expect you to help me achieve this.\n Communication - I am happy to shift directions in the course if it stops meeting your needs. I can only do that if you let me know that a change is necessary. Please feel free to provide feedback early and often.\n  You can expect the following from me:\nAvailability - This is a 1 credit course and your questions are likely to require more time than we can devote in class. I will do my best to make myself available outside of class hours to help you work through the spatial analysis problems that are slowing down your research progress.\n Balance - The goal of this course is to teach you general approaches and workflows for spatial analyses in R, not to troubleshoot individual coding problems. I will do my best to point you toward resources that can help you solve your individual problems without monopolizing the time of others in class.\n   Course materials All of the readings and software in this class are free. There are free online version of all the textbooks, R and RStudio are inherently free, and GSU provides free access to Adobe Illustrator.\nBooks, articles, and other materials We‚Äôll rely heavily on these books, which are all available online (for free!). I recommend getting the printed versions of these books if you are interested, but it is not required.\n Alberto Cairo, The Truthful Art: Data, Charts, and Maps for Communication (Berkeley, California: New Riders, 2016).\n $27 used, $32 new at Amazon. A free eBook version is available through GSU‚Äôs library through O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs Higher Education database. The easiest way to access it is to visit a special URL (http://go.oreilly.com/georgia-state-university), log in with your GSU account, and then search for ‚ÄúThe Truthful Art.‚Äù\n Kieran Healy, Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2018), http://socviz.co/.\n FREE online; $30 used, $36 new at Amazon.\n Claus E. Wilke, Fundamentals of Data Visualization (Sebastopol, California: O‚ÄôReilly Media, 2018), https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/.\n FREE online; $32 new at Amazon. An eBook version is also available through the O‚ÄôReilly database, but you can just use the online version. There will occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the content page for that session.\n  I also highly recommend subscribing to the R Weekly newsletter. This e-mail is sent every Monday and is full of helpful tutorials about how to do stuff with R.\n R and RStudio You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language R. You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard‚ÄîR handles all the calculations produces the actual statistics and graphical output, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\nR is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can (and should!) use the free RStudio.cloud service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won‚Äôt have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We will have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for examples, exercises, and mini projects.\nRStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets or more complicated analysis and graphics. You also can‚Äôt use your own custom fonts with RStudio.cloud. Over the course of the semester, you‚Äôll probably want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud. This isn‚Äôt 100% necessary, but it‚Äôs helpful.\nYou can find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.\n Online help Data science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and little errors in your code can cause hours of headache (even if you‚Äôve been doing this stuff for years!).\nFortunately there are tons of online resources to help you with this. Two of the most important are StackOverflow (a Q\u0026amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and RStudio Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e.¬†you)).\nIf you use Twitter, post R-related questions and content with #rstats. The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful.\nSearching for help with R on Google can sometimes be tricky because the program name is, um, a single letter. Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for ‚Äúr scatterplot,‚Äù but if it does struggle, try searching for ‚Äúrstats‚Äù instead (e.g.¬†‚Äúrstats scatterplot‚Äù). Also, since most of your R work will deal with ggplot2, it‚Äôs often easier to just search for that instead of the letter ‚Äúr‚Äù (e.g.¬†‚Äúggplot scatterplot‚Äù).\nAdditionally, we have a class chatroom at Slack where anyone in the class can ask questions and anyone can answer. I will monitor Slack regularly and will respond quickly. (It‚Äôs one of the rare Slack workspaces where I actually have notifications enabled!) Ask questions about the readings, exercises, and mini projects. You‚Äôll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you‚Äôll likely be able to answer other peoples‚Äô questions too.\n  Course schedule We have no regularly scheduled meeting times.\nInstead, 100% of the class content is asynchronous. You can do the readings and watch the videos on your own schedule at whatever time works best for you. Many of you work full time and you have childcare and parental care responsibilities, leaving you with only evenings for coursework. I‚Äôve designed this asynchronous system with you specifically in mind. I also can only really do teaching work at night when my kids are in bed‚ÄîI recorded all these videos between like 10 PM and 2 AM. We‚Äôre all in similar pandemic boats.\nEach session has (1) a set of readings and an accompanying lecture, (2) a lesson, (3) an example with lots of reference code, and (4) a short assignment. The schedule page provides an overview of all these moving parts.\nI recommend following this general process for each session:\n Do everything on the content () page Work through the lesson () page Complete the assignment () while referencing the example ()   Course policies Be nice. Be honest. Don‚Äôt cheat.\nWe will also follow Georgia State‚Äôs Code of Conduct.\nThis syllabus reflects a plan for the semester. Deviations may become necessary as the course progresses.\nStudent hours Please watch this video:\n Student hours are set times dedicated to all of you (most professors call these ‚Äúoffice hours‚Äù; I don‚Äôt1). This means that I will be in my office at home (wistfully) waiting for you to come by talk to me remotely with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns.\nBecause of the pandemic, we cannot meet in person. I can meet you online via Webex. Make an appointment with me here, and then use this link to talk to me during student hours: https://gsumeetings.webex.com/meet/aheiss. You can also find me through e-mail and Slack.\n Learning during a pandemic Life absolutely sucks right now. None of us is really okay. We‚Äôre all just pretending.\nYou most likely know people who have lost their jobs, have tested positive for COVID-19, have been hospitalized, or perhaps have even died. You all have increased (or possibly decreased) work responsibilities and increased family care responsibilities‚Äîyou might be caring for extra people (young and/or old!) right now, and you are likely facing uncertain job prospects (or have been laid off!).\nI‚Äôm fully committed to making sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class! I will make whatever accommodations I can to help you finish your exercises, do well on your projects, and learn and understand the class material. Under ordinary conditions, I am flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations when students face difficult challenges. Under pandemic conditions, that flexibility and leniency is intensified.\nIf you tell me you‚Äôre having trouble, I will not judge you or think less of you. I hope you‚Äôll extend me the same grace.\nYou never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical). You are always welcome to talk to me about things that you‚Äôre going through, though. If I can‚Äôt help you, I usually know somebody who can.\nIf you need extra help, or if you need more time with something, or if you feel like you‚Äôre behind or not understanding everything, do not suffer in silence! Talk to me! I will work with you. I promise.\nPlease sign up for a time to meet with me during student hours at https://calendly.com/andrewheiss/. I‚Äôm also available through e-mail and Slack. I‚Äôve enabled notifications on my Slack account, so I‚Äôll see your messages quickly!\nI want you to learn lots of things from this class (Graphic design! Fancy charts! R! ggplot!), but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.\n Late work With the exception of the mini projects and the final project, there‚Äôs no such late work. I would highly recommend staying caught up as much as possible, but if you need to turn something in late, that‚Äôs fine‚Äîthere‚Äôs no penalty.\n Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS) Life at GSU can be complicated and challenging (especially during a pandemic!). You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS) provides free, confidential support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. The CPS office is staffed by professional psychologists who are attuned to the needs of all types of college and professional students. Please do not hesitate to contact CPS for assistance‚Äîgetting help is a smart and courageous thing to do.\n Basic needs security If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, and you believe this may affect your performance in this course, please contact the Dean of Students for support. They can provide a host of services including free groceries from the Panther Pantry and assisting with homelessness with the Embark Network. Additionally, please talk to me if you are comfortable in doing so. This will enable me to provide any resources that I might possess.\n Lauren‚Äôs Promise I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\nLauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or GSU police (404-413-3333).\nIf you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources or call GSU‚Äôs Counseling and Psychological Services (404-413-1640).\nAny form of sexual harassment or violence will not be excused or tolerated at Georgia State. GSU has instituted procedures to respond to violations of these laws and standards, programs aimed at the prevention of such conduct, and intervention on behalf of the victims. Georgia State University Police officers will treat victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, and stalking with respect and dignity. Advocates on campus and in the community can help with victims‚Äô physical and emotional health, reporting options, and academic concerns.\n Academic honesty Violation of GSU‚Äôs Policy on Academic Honesty will result in an F in the course and possible disciplinary action.2 All violations will be formally reported to the Dean of Students.\n Special needs Students who wish to request accommodation for a disability may do so by registering with the Office of Disability Services. Students may only be accommodated upon issuance by the Office of Disability Services of a signed Accommodation Plan and are responsible for providing a copy of that plan to instructors of all classes in which accommodations are sought.\nStudents with special needs should then make an appointment with me during the first week of class to discuss any accommodations that need to be made.\n  Assignments and grades You can find descriptions for all the assignments on the assignments page.\n   Assignment Points Percent    Reflections (15 √ó 10) 150 23%  Exercises (15 √ó 10) 150 23%  Mini project 1 75 12%  Mini project 2 75 12%  Final project 200 31%  Total 650 ‚Äî        Grade Range Grade Range    A 93‚Äì100% C 73‚Äì76%  A‚àí 90‚Äì92% C‚àí 70‚Äì72%  B+ 87‚Äì89% D+ 67‚Äì69%  B 83‚Äì86% D 63‚Äì66%  B‚àí 80‚Äì82% D‚àí 60‚Äì62%  C+ 77‚Äì79% F \u0026lt; 60%       There‚Äôs fairly widespread misunderstanding about what office hours actually are!
