These assignements involve a mix of coding, analyis, and reflection. These exercises will have 1‚Äì5 short tasks that are directly related to the topic for the day along with 1-2 reflection questions. The material we cover in class along with the guided examples should be all you need to complete the assignments, but feel free to ask your classmates, the Intenets, or me if you get stuck. You may (and should!) work together on the exercises, but you must turn in your own answers.\nI will grade these memos using a check system:\n ‚úî+: (17.25 points (115%) in gradebook) Exercises are 100% completed. Every task was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Knitted document is clean and easy to follow. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often. ‚úî: (15 points (100%) in gradebook) Exercises are 70‚Äì99% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. ‚úî‚àí: (7.5 points (50%) in gradebook) Exercises are less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.  Notice that is essentially a pass/fail or completion-based system. I\u0026rsquo;m not grading your coding ability, I\u0026rsquo;m not counting the exact number of words you\u0026rsquo;re writing, and I\u0026rsquo;m not looking for encyclopedic citations of every single reading. I\u0026rsquo;m looking for a good faith effort and thoughtful engagement, that\u0026rsquo;s all. Do good work and you\u0026rsquo;ll get a ‚úì.\nYou will turn these exercises in using GitHub Classroom. .\nMini projects To give you practice with the data and design principles you\u0026rsquo;ll learn in this class, you will complete two mini projects. I will provide you with real-world data and pose one or more questions‚Äîyou will make a pretty picture to answer those questions.\nThe mini projects will be graded using a check system:\n ‚úî+: (57.5 points (‚âà115%) in gradebook) Project is phenomenally well-designed and uses advanced R techniques. The project uncovers an important story that is not readily apparent from just looking at the raw data. I will not assign these often. ‚úî: (50 points (100%) in gradebook) Project is fine, follows most design principles, answers a question from the data, and uses R correctly. This is the expected level of performance. ‚úî‚àí: (25 points (50%) in gradebook) Project is missing large components, is poorly designed, does not answer a relevant question, and/or uses R incorrectly. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.  Because these mini projects give you practice for the final project, I will provide you with substantial feedback on your design and code.\nFinal project At the end of the course, you will demonstrate your spatial analysis and visualization skills by completing a final project.\nComplete details for the final project (including past examples of excellent projects) are here.\nThere is no final exam. This project is your final exam.\nThe project will not be graded using a check system. Instead I will use a rubric to grade four elements of your project:\n Technical skills (is the workflow robust? Scaleable?) Quality of visualization (is a map necessary? how do we deal with uncertainty?) Story (Why do we care about this? Why does space matter?)  If you\u0026rsquo;ve engaged with the course content and completed the exercises and mini projects throughout the course, you should do just fine with the final project.\n","date":1630022400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1630022400,"objectID":"e18c399687bc0897ffd6503c7a1bbb8e","permalink":"http://isdrfall21.classes.spaseslab.com/assignment/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignment/","section":"assignment","summary":"You will get the most of out this class if you:\n Engage with the readings and lecture materials Regularly use R  Hopefully these assignements help reinforce those strategies.","tags":null,"title":"Assignment overview","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Modified from Andrew Heiss\nYou will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!) programming language R. You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Here are some instructions for how to get started.\nRStudio.cloud R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, we are going to use an RStudio server, a web-interface to RStudio, that is set up on the Boise State Research Computing cluster. This means you won\u0026rsquo;t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We will have a shared folder with the data for exercises and a Github workspace to allow easy access to code and templates.\nRStudio on your computer At some point you are likely to need a local version of R to run the analyses for your graduate work. Here\u0026rsquo;s how you install all these things\nInstall R First you need to install R itself (the engine).\n  Go to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)1 website: https://cran.r-project.org/\n  Click on \u0026ldquo;Download R for XXX\u0026rdquo;, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n  If you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (in this picture, it\u0026rsquo;s R-4.0.0.pkg; as of right now, the current version is also 4.0.0) and download it.\n  If you use Windows, click \u0026ldquo;base\u0026rdquo; (or click on the bolded \u0026ldquo;install R for the first time\u0026rdquo; link) and download it.\n    Double click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n  If you use macOS, download and install XQuartz. You do not need to do this on Windows.\n  Install RStudio Next, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won\u0026rsquo;t ever have to interact with it directly.\n  Go to the free download location on RStudio\u0026rsquo;s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\n  The website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n  Double click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n  Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\nInstall tidyverse R packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on \u0026ldquo;Install,\u0026rdquo; type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you\u0026rsquo;re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including ggplot2) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on \u0026ldquo;Install,\u0026rdquo; type \u0026ldquo;tidyverse\u0026rdquo;, and press enter. You\u0026rsquo;ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\nInstall gdal gdal is the \u0026lsquo;back-end\u0026rsquo; for most of the spatial packages in R. The easiest way to install gdal is to follow the instructions at the sf github page.\nInstall tinytex When you knit to PDF, R uses a special scientific typesetting program named LaTeX (pronounced \u0026ldquo;lay-tek\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;lah-tex\u0026rdquo;; for goofy nerdy reasons, the x is technically the \u0026ldquo;ch\u0026rdquo; sound in \u0026ldquo;Bach\u0026rdquo;, but most people just say it as \u0026ldquo;k\u0026rdquo;‚Äîsaying \u0026ldquo;layteks\u0026rdquo; is frowned on for whatever reason).\nLaTeX is neat and makes pretty documents, but it\u0026rsquo;s a huge program‚Äîthe macOS version, for instance, is nearly 4 GB! To make life easier, there\u0026rsquo;s an R package named tinytex that installs a minimal LaTeX program and that automatically deals with differences between macOS and Windows.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how to install tinytex so you can knit to pretty PDFs:\n Use the Packages in panel in RStudio to install tinytex like you did above with tidyverse. Alternatively, run install.packages(\u0026quot;tinytex\u0026quot;) in the console. Run tinytex::install_tinytex() in the console. Wait for a bit while R downloads and installs everything you need. The end! You should now be able to knit to PDF.    It\u0026rsquo;s a goofy name, but CRAN is where most R packages‚Äîand R itself‚Äîlives.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627776000,"objectID":"c5e6c5f0d0baae071e282245bbba803c","permalink":"http://isdrfall21.classes.spaseslab.com/resource/install/","publishdate":"2021-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resource/install/","section":"resource","summary":"Modified from Andrew Heiss\nYou will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!) programming language R.

Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for \u0026ldquo;r scatterplot\u0026rdquo;, but if it does struggle, try searching for \u0026ldquo;rstats\u0026rdquo; instead (e.g. \u0026ldquo;rstats scatterplot\u0026rdquo;). Also, since most of your R work in this class will deal with ggplot2, it\u0026rsquo;s often easier to just search for that instead of the letter \u0026ldquo;r\u0026rdquo; (e.g. \u0026ldquo;ggplot scatterplot\u0026rdquo;).\nThese resources are also really really helpful:\nGeneral R Resources  An Introduction to R: The definitive introductory text by Venables, Smith, and the R Core Team.

Workflows for rasters are basically the same as those for vectors (i.e., read the data, compare CRSs, reproject if necessary). The main difference is that rasters introduce a few additional components that we need to match up - the orgin, extent, and resolution. We\u0026rsquo;ll start by looking at how we can verify if/when things are aligned and then move to \u0026lsquo;fixing\u0026rsquo; issues of non-alignment.\nRead the data We use the rast() function from the terra package to read the data into our workspace. Note that the pathnames here are not the same as what you\u0026rsquo;ll use for the lab (because these paths correspond to my computer).\nhm \u0026lt;- rast('/Users/mattwilliamson/Google Drive/My Drive/TEACHING/Intro_Spatial_Data_R/Data/session08/hmi.tif') val \u0026lt;- rast('/Users/mattwilliamson/Google Drive/My Drive/TEACHING/Intro_Spatial_Data_R/Data/session08/idval.tif')  Check the projection Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the data. We notice a few obvious differences right off the bat.\nThe plots make it pretty obvious that our extents are different, but what else might be different? Let\u0026rsquo;s use the terra::crs command to check on the different Coordinate Reference Systems.\ncrs(val) == crs(hm)  ## [1] FALSE  crs(hm, proj=TRUE) #use the proj argument to make the output a bit more readable (but deprecated)  ## [1] \u0026quot;+proj=aea +lat_0=37.5 +lon_0=-96 +lat_1=29.5 +lat_2=45.5 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs\u0026quot;  crs(val, proj=TRUE)  ## [1] \u0026quot;+proj=aea +lat_0=23 +lon_0=-96 +lat_1=29.5 +lat_2=45.5 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs\u0026quot;  Reproject and crop the raster As we have discussed, projecting rasters is a bit tricky because we can distort the cells and potentially alter the attribute-geometry-relationship. That said, we often don\u0026rsquo;t want to deal with giant rasters when we are only analyzing a small area. Cropping can help us reduce the size of the rasters, but will require us to reproject one of the rasters to get there. Let\u0026rsquo;s reproject the smaller raster (because it\u0026rsquo;s faster) and then crop the large raster.\nval.proj \u0026lt;- project(val, crs(hm)) hm.crop \u0026lt;- crop(hm, val.proj)  This is looking better, does this mean we have the two rasters aligned?\ncrs(hm.crop) == crs(val.proj)  ## [1] FALSE  Looks like something else might still be off. Let\u0026rsquo;s check the resolution, origin, and extent.\nResampling, aggregating, disaggregating res(hm.crop) == res(val.proj)  ## [1] FALSE FALSE  ext(hm.crop) == ext(val.proj)  ## [1] FALSE  origin(hm.crop) == origin(val.proj)  ## [1] FALSE FALSE  As you can see, the two rasters have different resolutions, extents, and origins. Although, we reprojected the data into the proper projection, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t change these other fundamental properties of the data. We\u0026rsquo;ll use resample() here to fix this because we need to both change the resolution and the location of the cell centers (if we were just changing resolutions, we could use aggregate(), or disaggregate()). We\u0026rsquo;ll resample to the coarser resolution, but we could go the other way if it made sense for the data.\nres(hm.crop)  ## [1] 270 270  res(val.proj)  ## [1] 480 480  hm.rsmple \u0026lt;- resample(hm.crop, val.proj, method='bilinear') crs(hm.rsmple) == crs(val.proj)  ## [1] TRUE  Running functions on multi-layer rasters Great, we\u0026rsquo;ve gotten our data aligned. Let\u0026rsquo;s make a single SpatRast object with 2 layers so that we can run some smoothing.\ncombined.data \u0026lt;- rast(list(hm.rsmple, val.proj)) nlyr(combined.data)  ## [1] 2  plot(combined.data)  One of the nice parts about multilayer rasters is that we can run functions across all pixels in all the layers of a multilayer raster with relative ease. One place we might use this is to scale and center our data before a regression analysis.\ncombined.scale \u0026lt;- scale(combined.data) plot(combined.scale)  Repetitive operations One of the things you\u0026rsquo;ll notice is that you end up doing a lot of copy-and-pasting when you\u0026rsquo;re processing lots of rasters. This can lead to errors that can be really difficult to diagnose. One way around this is to build functions that take \u0026lsquo;anonymous\u0026rsquo; arguments.\n","date":1631750400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631750400,"objectID":"6f53462a8592f62079eae96e15826cef","permalink":"http://isdrfall21.classes.spaseslab.com/example/04-example/","publishdate":"2021-09-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/example/04-example/","section":"example","summary":"As we have discussed (constantly), we need to get all of our data aligned before we can do much with spatial analysis or plotting.

We\u0026rsquo;ll build a few vectors from scratch and then move on to explore a broader suite of common vector operations implemented by the sf package.\nA reminder about vector geometries in R You\u0026rsquo;ll recall that the sf package organizes the different types of vectors (e.g., points, lines, polygons) in to a hierarchical structure organized by complexity of geometries contained within an R object. For example, a single point will be a POINT, several points will be a MULTIPOINT, and an object containing points, polygons, and lines will be a GEOMETRYCOLLECTION. We need to be aware of what types of geometries and objects we have becasue some operations are restricted to particular types of objects or geometries as indicated by errors that read:\nError in UseMethod(\u0026quot;st_crs\u0026lt;-\u0026quot;) : no applicable method for 'st_crs\u0026lt;-' applied to an object of class \u0026quot;c('XY', 'POINT', 'sfg')\u0026quot;\nwhich indicates that the function (st_crs) does not have a method defined for the type of object it\u0026rsquo;s being applied to. Note that the function inside UseMethod will be replaced by whichever function you\u0026rsquo;re attempting to apply to your object and the object of class component will vary based on the function and the object class.\n   type description     POINT single point geometry   MULTIPOINT set of points   LINESTRING single linestring (two or more points connected by straight lines)   MULTILINESTRING set of linestrings   POLYGON exterior ring with zero or more inner rings, denoting holes   MULTIPOLYGON set of polygons   GEOMETRYCOLLECTION set of the geometries above    As is, these geometries are built on vertices with coordinates that are based on the Cartesian plane and thus are \u0026ldquo;spatial\u0026rdquo;, but not georeferenced or geographic. In order to convert these sf geometries to a geogrphic object (i.e., one with a CRS and whose location depicts and actual spot on the earth\u0026rsquo;s surface), we use st_sfc() to create a simple feature geography list column (see ?st_sfc for an example of this workflow).\nConventions in sf and the tidyverse One of the benefits of the sf package is that it is designed to interface with the tidyverse suite of packages. One of the appealing parts of working with tidyverse packages is that they share an underlying philosophy, data structure, and grammar. This can make life a lot easier as you move from getting your data into R, constructing a set of covariates (including those derived from spatial data), analyzing, and plotting (or mapping) those data. People have strong opinions about the tidyverse, but I find it to be an (eventually) useful way for people to gain some intuition for working in R. One of the grammatical conventions used in the tidyverse suite of packages is the use _ in function calls (this is known as snake case should you ever need to know that at a dinner party). The _ is typically used to separate the verb in a function call from its predicate. For example, bind_rows() in the dplyr package \u0026ldquo;binds\u0026rdquo; (the verb) rows (the predicate) wheras bind_cols() binds columns. For the sf package it\u0026rsquo;s slightly different in that most of the functions begin with a st_ or sf_ prefix to indicate that the function is designed to work on spatial objects followed by a word (or words) describing what the operation does (e.g., st_centroid() returns a MULTIPOINT object with each point located at the centroid of a polygon). We can classify these functions based on what they are expected to return:\n  Predicates: evaluate a logical statement asserting that a property is TRUE\n  Measures: return a numeric value with units based on the units of the CRS\n  Transformations: create new geometries based on input geometries.\n  We can also distinguish these functions based on how many geometries that operate on:\n Unary: operate on a single geometry at a time (meaning that if you have a MULTI* object the function works on each geometry individually) Binary: operate on pairs of geometries n-ary: operate on sets of geometries  We\u0026rsquo;ll focus on the unary operators for now, but the binary and n-ary operators will become more important as we move to develop databases for spatial analysis.\nUnary predicates Unary predicates are helpful \u0026lsquo;checks\u0026rsquo; to make sure the object you are working with has the properties you might expect. Are the geometries valid? Is the data projected? Because we are asking a set of TRUE/FALSE questions, these functions are specified as st_is_:\n   predicate asks\u0026hellip;     simple is the geometry self-intersecting (i.e., simple)?   valid is the geometry valid?   empty is the geometry column of an object empty?   longlat does the object have geographic coordinates? (FALSE if coords are projected, NA if no crs)   is(geometry, class) is the geometry of a particular class?    nc \u0026lt;- st_read(system.file(\u0026quot;shape/nc.shp\u0026quot;, package=\u0026quot;sf\u0026quot;))  ## Reading layer `nc' from data source ## `/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.0/Resources/library/sf/shape/nc.shp' ## using driver `ESRI Shapefile' ## Simple feature collection with 100 features and 14 fields ## Geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: -84.32385 ymin: 33.88199 xmax: -75.45698 ymax: 36.58965 ## Geodetic CRS: NAD27  st_is_longlat(nc)  ## [1] TRUE  st_is_valid(nc)  ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ## [16] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ## [31] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ## [46] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ## [61] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ## [76] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ## [91] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE  Unary measures Measures return a quantity that describes the geometry\n   measure returns     dimension 0 for points, 1 for linear, 2 for polygons, possibly NA for empty geometries   area the area of a geometry   length the length of a linear geometry    distance is a binary measure that returns the distance between pairs of geometries either within a single object or between features in multiple objects\nhead(st_area(nc))  ## Units: [m^2] ## [1] 1137107793 610916077 1423145355 694378925 1520366979 967504822  st_distance(nc)[1:5,1:5]  ## Units: [m] ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 0.0 0.0 25591.8 439493.26 299049.94 ## [2,] 0.0 0.0 0.0 408416.68 268284.09 ## [3,] 25591.8 0.0 0.0 366648.94 226461.23 ## [4,] 439493.3 408416.7 366648.9 0.00 67066.43 ## [5,] 299049.9 268284.1 226461.2 67066.43 0.00  Unary transformers Unary transformations work on a per object basis and return a new geometry for each geometry.

The dplyr package has a ton of helpful functions for maniputlating data in R. For example, we might select a single row from a shapefile based on the value of its attributes by using the dplyr::filter() command:\ndurham.cty \u0026lt;- nc %\u0026gt;% filter(., NAME == \u0026quot;Durham\u0026quot;) ## We can also use the bracket approach durham.cty2 \u0026lt;- nc[nc$NAME == \u0026quot;Durham\u0026quot;,] plot(st_geometry(nc)) plot(st_geometry(durham.cty), add=TRUE, col=\u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;)  Or perhaps we only want a few of the columns in the dataset (because shapefiles always have lots of extra stuff). We can use dplyr::select() to choose columns by name:\nnc.select \u0026lt;- nc %\u0026gt;% select(., c(\u0026quot;CNTY_ID\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;NAME\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;FIPS\u0026quot;)) plot(nc.select)  Notice that the geometries are sticky, this will be important later\n","date":1631145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631145600,"objectID":"f32819d9b39039a397d58dd37d2f3efa","permalink":"http://isdrfall21.classes.spaseslab.com/example/03-example/","publishdate":"2021-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/example/03-example/","section":"example","summary":"Today we\u0026rsquo;ll build on the introductory discussion we were having about vector operations and the sf package.

This is not an ideal practice as it makes it challenging for others to automatically reproduce your analaysis, but I\u0026rsquo;m using here because GitHub can\u0026rsquo;t handle large files like rasters or shapefiles and transferring files is more than I want to take on today\u0026hellip;.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll demonstrate loading the data using rgdal, sp, and sf packages (for shapefiles) and the raster and terra packages (for rasters).\n#load the necessary libraries library(sp) library(sf)  ## Linking to GEOS 3.9.1, GDAL 3.2.2, PROJ 7.2.1  library(rgdal)  ## rgdal: version: 1.5-23, (SVN revision 1121) ## Geospatial Data Abstraction Library extensions to R successfully loaded ## Loaded GDAL runtime: GDAL 3.1.4, released 2020/10/20 ## Path to GDAL shared files: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.0/Resources/library/rgdal/gdal ## GDAL binary built with GEOS: TRUE ## Loaded PROJ runtime: Rel. 6.3.1, February 10th, 2020, [PJ_VERSION: 631] ## Path to PROJ shared files: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.0/Resources/library/rgdal/proj ## Linking to sp version:1.4-5 ## To mute warnings of possible GDAL/OSR exportToProj4() degradation, ## use options(\u0026quot;rgdal_show_exportToProj4_warnings\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;none\u0026quot;) before loading rgdal.  library(raster) library(terra)  ## terra version 1.2.11  ## ## Attaching package: 'terra'  ## The following object is masked from 'package:rgdal': ## ## project  filepath \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;/Users/mattwilliamson/Google Drive/My Drive/TEACHING/Intro_Spatial_Data_R/Data/session04/\u0026quot; #shapefiles id.sp \u0026lt;- readOGR(paste0(filepath, \u0026quot;ID.shp\u0026quot;))  ## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile ## Source: \u0026quot;/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/TEACHING/Intro_Spatial_Data_R/Data/session04/ID.shp\u0026quot;, layer: \u0026quot;ID\u0026quot; ## with 1 features ## It has 14 fields  id.sf \u0026lt;- st_read(paste0(filepath, \u0026quot;ID.shp\u0026quot;))  ## Reading layer `ID' from data source ## `/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/TEACHING/Intro_Spatial_Data_R/Data/session04/ID.shp' ## using driver `ESRI Shapefile' ## Simple feature collection with 1 feature and 14 fields ## Geometry type: POLYGON ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: -117.243 ymin: 41.98818 xmax: -111.0435 ymax: 49.00085 ## Geodetic CRS: NAD83  #rasters id.raster \u0026lt;- raster(paste0(filepath, \u0026quot;idval.tif\u0026quot;)) id.rast \u0026lt;- rast(paste0(filepath, \u0026quot;idval.tif\u0026quot;))  Check the geometry Polygon data is often developed by hand using a technique called \u0026lsquo;heads-up digitizing\u0026rsquo;. This can lead to some subtle, but important errors in the geometry that eventually create problems for us down the road. We can check that using st_is_vald() and if that returns FALSE we can use st_make_valid() to fix it (hopefully).\nst_is_valid(id.sf)  ## [1] TRUE  #luckily it's true so we don't need st_make_valid() here  Once we\u0026rsquo;ve got the data into R, we probably want to take a look at it. We can do that quickly just using the base plot function (we\u0026rsquo;ll use fancier methods later).\nplot(id.raster) plot(id.sp, add=TRUE)  plot(id.rast) plot(st_geometry(id.sf), add=TRUE)  What do you notice? The Idaho shapefile doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up!! Leading us to our next step:\nCheck the projections As we discussed in class, we can\u0026rsquo;t really do much with spatial data in R until we get all the pieces aligned. The plot suggests the data aren\u0026rsquo;t in the same projection, but we can check that more formally, here. Notice the use of as to coerce the sf object into a Spatial* object. This is necessary in a number of places because certain operations are only defined for a subset of R objects.\nproj4string(id.sp) == proj4string(id.raster)  ## Warning in proj4string(id.sp): CRS object has comment, which is lost in output  ## [1] FALSE  st_crs(id.sf) == st_crs(id.raster)  ## [1] FALSE  identicalCRS(id.sp, id.raster)  ## [1] FALSE  identicalCRS(as(id.sf, \u0026quot;Spatial\u0026quot;), id.raster)  ## [1] FALSE  Reproject the data As the tests above indicate, our data are not in the same projection. We need to reproject them!! Here are a few ways to do it. Notice that I demonstrate how to project the rasters to the shapefile projection - I generally don\u0026rsquo;t recommend this, but am showing it here for completeness.\nnew.crs \u0026lt;- CRS(\u0026quot;+init=epsg:2163\u0026quot;)  ## Warning in showSRID(uprojargs, format = \u0026quot;PROJ\u0026quot;, multiline = \u0026quot;NO\u0026quot;, prefer_proj = ## prefer_proj): Discarded datum unknown in Proj4 definition  id.sf.proj \u0026lt;- id.sf %\u0026gt;% st_transform(., new.crs) id.sp.proj \u0026lt;- spTransform(id.sp, new.crs) id.raster.proj \u0026lt;- projectRaster(id.raster, res = 480, crs=new.crs) id.rast.proj \u0026lt;- terra::project(id.rast, as(id.raster.proj, \u0026quot;SpatRaster\u0026quot;))  Let\u0026rsquo;s see if that worked Always good to double-check\u0026hellip;\nproj4string(id.sp.proj) == proj4string(id.raster.proj)  ## Warning in proj4string(id.sp.proj): CRS object has comment, which is lost in ## output  ## [1] TRUE  st_crs(id.sf.proj) == st_crs(id.raster.proj)  ## [1] TRUE  identicalCRS(id.sp.proj, id.raster.proj)  ## [1] TRUE  identicalCRS(as(id.sf.proj, \u0026quot;Spatial\u0026quot;), id.raster.proj)  ## [1] TRUE  Plot it again Now it looks like everything is lined up, we should be able to generate a quick plot to look at that data\nplot(id.raster.proj) plot(id.sp.proj, add=TRUE)  Or using the sf st_geometry command:\nplot(id.rast.proj) plot(st_geometry(id.sf.proj), add=TRUE)  ","date":1630454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630454400,"objectID":"f8bbc05c75c3ee5e0fdfe484a8034c6c","permalink":"http://isdrfall21.classes.spaseslab.com/example/02-example/","publishdate":"2021-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/example/02-example/","section":"example","summary":"Today\u0026rsquo;s exercise and assignment will focus on getting different types of spatial data into R; exploring the CRS, extent, and resolution of those objects; and aligning objects with different projections.

This allows each of you to have your own repositories for version control and backup of your code without the worries of stepping on someone else toes. The goal of this class is not to have you become a \u0026lsquo;master\u0026rsquo; of all things git, but I am hoping you\u0026rsquo;ll learn the utility of version control and adopt as much of it as make sense for you and your workflows.\nAccept the invitation to the assignment repo The first thing you\u0026rsquo;ll need to do is accept the invitation to \u0026lsquo;assignment-1` repository (repo). This should automatically clone (make an exact copy) of the assignment repo in your personal account.\nMaking sure Rstudio server can access your GitHub account Unfortunately, GitHub has ended its support for username/password remote authentication. Instead, it uses something called a Personal Access Token. You can read more about it here if you are interested, but the easiest way to deal with this is by following Jenny Bryan\u0026rsquo;s happygitwithr recommended approach:\n Introduce yourself to git: There are a number of ways to do this, but I find this to be the easiest  library(usethis) #you may need to install this using install.packages('usethis') use_git_config(user.name = \u0026quot;Jane Doe\u0026quot;, user.email = \u0026quot;jane@example.org\u0026quot;) #your info here  Get a PAT if you don\u0026rsquo;t have one already (make sure you save it somewhere)  usethis::create_github_token()  Store your credential for use in RStudio  library(gitcreds) #may need to install this too gitcreds_set() #should prompt you for your pat - paste it here  Verify that Rstudio has saved your credential  gitcreds_get()  R should return something that looks like this:\nBring the project into RStudio Go to File\u0026gt;New Project and choose the \u0026ldquo;Version Control\u0026rdquo; option Select \u0026ldquo;Git\u0026rdquo; (Not Subversion) paste the link from the \u0026ldquo;Clone Repository\u0026rdquo; button into the \u0026ldquo;Repository URL\u0026rdquo; space  Verify that the \u0026ldquo;Git\u0026rdquo; tab is available and that your project is shown in the upper right-hand corner Assuming all this has worked, you should be able to click on the \u0026ldquo;Git\u0026rdquo; tab and see something like this:\nBasic workflow   Everytime you begin working on code, make sure you \u0026ldquo;Pull\u0026rdquo; from the remote repository to make sure you have the most recent version of things (this is especially important when you are collaborating with people).\n  Make some changes to code\n  Save those changes\n  \u0026ldquo;Commit\u0026rdquo; those changes - Think of commits as \u0026lsquo;breadcrumbs\u0026rsquo; they help you remember where you were in the coding process in case you need to revert back to a previous version. Your commit messages should help you remember what was \u0026lsquo;happening\u0026rsquo; in the code when you made the commit. In general, you should save and commit fairly frequently and especially everytime you do something \u0026lsquo;consequential\u0026rsquo;. Git allows you to \u0026lsquo;turn back time\u0026rsquo;, but that\u0026rsquo;s only useful if you left enough information to get back to where you want to be.\n  Push your work to the remote - when you\u0026rsquo;re done working on the project for the day, push your local changes to the remote. This will ensure that if you switch computers or if someone else is going to work on the project, you (or they) will have the most recent version. Plus, if you don\u0026rsquo;t do this, step 1 will really mess you up.\n  R Markdown This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com. We\u0026rsquo;ll be using Rmarkdown for the assignments in class and this website was built (generally) using Rmarkdown. You can create new Rmarkdown documents by going to File \u0026raquo; New File \u0026raquo; New Rmarkdown (we\u0026rsquo;ll be using html for this class)\nWhen you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.\nThere are lots of helpful resources to help you get started using Rmarkdown. There\u0026rsquo;s a cheatsheet and a much longer user\u0026rsquo;s guide. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect you to become an expert in Rmarkdown, but it is a helpful way to keep all of your thougths and code together in a single, coherent document. Getting proficient in Rmarkdown and git allows you to work with collaborators on an analysis, graphics, and manuscript all within a single platform. This fully-integrated workflow takes practice and patience (especially when you have collaborators that are new to this approach), this course is just an initial step down that path. I\u0026rsquo;ll do my best to keep it simple - please let me know if you have questions!\nYou can embed an R code chunk like this:\nsummary(cars)  ## speed dist ## Min. : 4.0 Min. : 2.00 ## 1st Qu.:12.0 1st Qu.: 26.00 ## Median :15.0 Median : 36.00 ## Mean :15.4 Mean : 42.98 ## 3rd Qu.:19.0 3rd Qu.: 56.00 ## Max. :25.0 Max. :120.00  Including Plots You can also embed plots, for example:\nNote that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\nData Types and Structures Data Types Okay, now that we have all of those details out of the way, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at data structures in R. As we discussed,R has six basic types of data: numeric, integer, logical, complex, character, and raw. For this class, we won\u0026rsquo;t bother with complex or raw as you are unlikely to encounter them in your introductory spatial explorations.\n  Numeric data are numbers that contain a decimal. They can also be whole numbers\n  Integers are whole numbers (those numbers without a decimal point).\n  Logical data take on the value of either TRUE or FALSE. There‚Äôs also another special type of logical called NA to represent missing values.\n  Character data represent string values. You can think of character strings as something like a word (or multiple words). A special type of character string is a factor, which is a string but with additional attributes (like levels or an order). Factors become important in the analyses and visualizations we\u0026rsquo;ll attempt later in the course.\n  There are a variety of ways to learn more about the structure of different data types:\n class() - returns the type of object (high level) typeof() - returns the type of object (low level) length() tells you about the length of an object attributes() - does the object have any metadata  num \u0026lt;- 2.2 class(num)  ## [1] \u0026quot;numeric\u0026quot;  typeof(num)  ## [1] \u0026quot;double\u0026quot;  y \u0026lt;- 1:10 y  ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  class(y)  ## [1] \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot;  typeof(y)  ## [1] \u0026quot;integer\u0026quot;  length(y)  ## [1] 10  b \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;3\u0026quot; class(b)  ## [1] \u0026quot;character\u0026quot;  is.numeric(b)  ## [1] FALSE  c \u0026lt;- as.numeric(b) class(c)  ## [1] \u0026quot;numeric\u0026quot;  Data Structures You can store information in a variety of ways in R. The types we are most likely to encounter this semester are:\n Vectors: a collection of elements that are typically character, logical, integer, or numeric.  #sometimes we'll need to make sequences of numbers to facilitate joins series \u0026lt;- 1:10 series.2 \u0026lt;- seq(10) series.3 \u0026lt;- seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 0.1) series  ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  series.2  ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  series.3  ## [1] 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 ## [16] 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 ## [31] 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6 4.7 4.8 4.9 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4 ## [46] 5.5 5.6 5.7 5.8 5.9 6.0 6.1 6.2 6.3 6.4 6.5 6.6 6.7 6.8 6.9 ## [61] 7.0 7.1 7.2 7.3 7.4 7.5 7.6 7.7 7.8 7.9 8.0 8.1 8.2 8.3 8.4 ## [76] 8.5 8.6 8.7 8.8 8.9 9.0 9.1 9.2 9.3 9.4 9.5 9.6 9.7 9.8 9.9 ## [91] 10.0  c(series.2, series.3)  ## [1] 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 ## [16] 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 ## [31] 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 ## [46] 4.5 4.6 4.7 4.8 4.9 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4 5.5 5.6 5.7 5.8 5.9 ## [61] 6.0 6.1 6.2 6.3 6.4 6.5 6.6 6.7 6.8 6.9 7.0 7.1 7.2 7.3 7.4 ## [76] 7.5 7.6 7.7 7.8 7.9 8.0 8.1 8.2 8.3 8.4 8.5 8.6 8.7 8.8 8.9 ## [91] 9.0 9.1 9.2 9.3 9.4 9.5 9.6 9.7 9.8 9.9 10.0  class(series.3)  ## [1] \u0026quot;numeric\u0026quot;  typeof(series.3)  ## [1] \u0026quot;double\u0026quot;  length(series.3)  ## [1] 91   Missing Data: R supports missing data in most of the data structures we use, but they can lead to some strange behaviors. Here are a few ways to find missing data:  x \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, NA, \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;d\u0026quot;, NA) is.na(x)  ## [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE  anyNA(x)  ## [1] TRUE   Matrices: are an extension of the numeric or character vectors. They are not a separate type of object but simply an atomic vector with dimensions; the number of rows and columns. As with atomic vectors, the elements of a matrix must be of the same data. Matrices are the foundation of rasters, which we\u0026rsquo;ll be discussing frequently throughout the course  #matrices are filled columnwise in R m \u0026lt;- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3) dim(m)  ## [1] 2 3  x \u0026lt;- 1:3 y \u0026lt;- 10:12 a \u0026lt;- cbind(x, y) dim(a)  ## [1] 3 2  a[3,1]  ## x ## 3  b \u0026lt;- rbind(x, y) dim(b)  ## [1] 2 3  b[1,3]  ## x ## 3   Lists: Lists essentially act like containers in R - they can hold a variety of different data types and structures including more lists. We use lists a lot for functional programming in R where we can apply a function to each element in a list. We\u0026rsquo;ll see this with extracting values from multiple rasters. We can extract elements of lists usin [] and [[]]  x \u0026lt;- list(1, \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;, TRUE, 1+4i) x  ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; ## ## [[3]] ## [1] TRUE ## ## [[4]] ## [1] 1+4i  #adding names xlist \u0026lt;- list(a = \u0026quot;Waldo\u0026quot;, b = 1:10, data = head(mtcars)) xlist  ## $a ## [1] \u0026quot;Waldo\u0026quot; ## ## $b ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ## ## $data ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1  xlist[[1]]  ## [1] \u0026quot;Waldo\u0026quot;  xlist[[3]]  ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1  xlist[[3]][1]  ## mpg ## Mazda RX4 21.0 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 ## Datsun 710 22.8 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 ## Valiant 18.1  xlist[[3]][1,2]  ## [1] 6  xlist[3][1]  ## $data ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1   Data Frames: data frames resemble that tabular datasets you might be used to in spreadsheet programs and are probably one of the most common types of data in R. A data frame is a special type of list where every element has the same length (but can have different types of data). We\u0026rsquo;ll be reading in a number of data frames for this first assignment.  dat \u0026lt;- data.frame(id = letters[1:10], x = 1:10, y = 11:20) dat  ## id x y ## 1 a 1 11 ## 2 b 2 12 ## 3 c 3 13 ## 4 d 4 14 ## 5 e 5 15 ## 6 f 6 16 ## 7 g 7 17 ## 8 h 8 18 ## 9 i 9 19 ## 10 j 10 20  is.list(dat)  ## [1] TRUE  class(dat)  ## [1] \u0026quot;data.frame\u0026quot;  #lots of ways to look at data in data frames str(dat) #compact summary of the structure of a dataframe  ## 'data.frame':\t10 obs. of 3 variables: ## $ id: chr \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; \u0026quot;b\u0026quot; \u0026quot;c\u0026quot; \u0026quot;d\u0026quot; ... ## $ x : int 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ## $ y : int 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20  head(dat) #gives the first 6 rows similar to tail()  ## id x y ## 1 a 1 11 ## 2 b 2 12 ## 3 c 3 13 ## 4 d 4 14 ## 5 e 5 15 ## 6 f 6 16  dim(dat)  ## [1] 10 3  colnames(dat)  ## [1] \u0026quot;id\u0026quot; \u0026quot;x\u0026quot; \u0026quot;y\u0026quot;  ## accessing elements of a dataframe dat[1,3]  ## [1] 11  dat[[\u0026quot;y\u0026quot;]]  ## [1] 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20  dat$y  ## [1] 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   Tibbles: are similar to data frames, but allow for lists within columns. They are designed for use with the tidyverse (which we\u0026rsquo;ll explore more in future classes), but the primary reason for introducing them here is because they are the foundation of sf objects which we\u0026rsquo;ll use frequently in the weeks to come.  library(tidyverse)  ## ‚îÄ‚îÄ Attaching packages ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ tidyverse 1.3.1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ  ## ‚úì ggplot2 3.3.5 ‚úì purrr 0.3.4 ## ‚úì tibble 3.1.3 ‚úì dplyr 1.0.7 ## ‚úì tidyr 1.1.3 ‚úì stringr 1.4.0 ## ‚úì readr 2.0.1 ‚úì forcats 0.5.1  ## ‚îÄ‚îÄ Conflicts ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ tidyverse_conflicts() ‚îÄ‚îÄ ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag()  dat.tib \u0026lt;- tibble(dat) is.list(dat.tib)  ## [1] TRUE  class(dat.tib)  ## [1] \u0026quot;tbl_df\u0026quot; \u0026quot;tbl\u0026quot; \u0026quot;data.frame\u0026quot;  #lots of ways to look at data in data frames str(dat.tib) #compact summary of the structure of a dataframe  ## tibble [10 √ó 3] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ id: chr [1:10] \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; \u0026quot;b\u0026quot; \u0026quot;c\u0026quot; \u0026quot;d\u0026quot; ... ## $ x : int [1:10] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ## $ y : int [1:10] 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20  head(dat.tib) #gives the first 6 rows similar to tail()  ## # A tibble: 6 √ó 3 ## id x y ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; ## 1 a 1 11 ## 2 b 2 12 ## 3 c 3 13 ## 4 d 4 14 ## 5 e 5 15 ## 6 f 6 16  dim(dat.tib)  ## [1] 10 3  colnames(dat.tib)  ## [1] \u0026quot;id\u0026quot; \u0026quot;x\u0026quot; \u0026quot;y\u0026quot;  ## accessing elements of a dataframe dat.tib[1,3]  ## # A tibble: 1 √ó 1 ## y ## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; ## 1 11  dat.tib[[\u0026quot;y\u0026quot;]]  ## [1] 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20  dat.tib$y  ## [1] 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20  Many of the packages used for spatial operations in R rely on special objects (e.g., Spatial*, RasterLayer) that are combinations of these various elemental data types.

You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you\u0026rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() ```  renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head()  Charts Academic supports the popular Plotly chart format.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026quot;chart\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\n  (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\"./line-chart.json\", function(chart) { Plotly.plot('chart-421386975', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();  You might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |} {\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$  renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\\\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  renders as\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\n1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ```  renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2]  An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!

I will try to respond to all course-related e-mails and Slack messages within 48 hours (please allow additional time if you send your message during the weekend).\n \nCourse Description Spatial data are ubiquitous and form the basis for many of our inquiries into social, ecological, and evolutionary processes. As such, developing the skills necessary for incorporating spatial data into reproducible statistical workflows is critical. In this course, we will introduce the core components of manipulating spatial data within the R statistical environment including managing vector and raster data, projections, extraction of data values, interpolation, and plotting. Students will also learn to prototype and benchmark different workflows to aid in applying the appropriate tools to their research questions.\n Course Objectives Students completing this course should be able to:\n Develop reproducible workflows for manipulating, visualizing, and analyzing spatial data. Understand the unique components of spatial data and how those components fit in R‚Äôs data structures. Articulate the different formats of spatial data and identify which R packages are suited to each type. Describe why space matters for many social and ecological questions Implement a variety of descriptive and statistical spatial analyses. Leverage functional programming to automate and expedite spatial data operations.   Expectations Be nice. Be honest. Try hard.\nThe beauty of working with open source software is the community of users working on problems just like yours (and nothing like yours). Like any community, this one functions best when its members are kind, genuine, and make good-faith efforts to solve the problems along the way (more on this below).\n Prerequisite Knowledge and Skills You can succeed in this class.\nSome familiarity with the R statistical environment is helpful, but not necessary. My goal is to foster an environment where we are all learning from each other and sharing the tips and tricks that help us along the way. Learning R can be difficult at first‚Äîit‚Äôs like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. I find it helpful to remember the following:\n It‚Äôs easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs me, I‚Äôm really stupid,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not made out to program.‚Äù But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It‚Äôs just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don‚Äôt blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later. Even experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you‚Äôre finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, e-mail me, etc.  ‚Äî Hadley Wickham   If you want to start learning a few of the basics, the Resources tab has some background information to get you started. Note that this is not an exhaustive list - the number of new R tutorials available on the internet seems to be growing exponentially.\nGetting help with R problems I am happy to help you work through your R coding challenges, but there are a lot of you and only one of me. Moreover, I may not always know exactly how to fix your problem any better than you do. In order to make sure that I am not the primary obstacle to your ability to complete the class assignements, I‚Äôm asking that you use the following steps prior to emailing/Slacking me with your coding questions.\nGoogle it! Searching for help with R on Google can sometimes be tricky. Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for ‚Äúr reproject polygons,‚Äù but if it does struggle, try searching for ‚Äúrstats‚Äù instead (e.g.¬†‚Äúrstats reproject polygons‚Äù). Also, since most of your R work will deal with the RSpatial packages, it‚Äôs often easier to just search for the package name and operation rather than the letter ‚Äúr‚Äù (e.g.¬†‚Äúsf reproject polygons‚Äù). I often paste the specific error message I get along with the spatial package I‚Äôm using to try and help Google find my solutions.\n Ask your colleagues We have an r_spatial chatroom at Slack where anyone in this class can ask questions and anyone can answer. Ask questions about code or class materials. You‚Äôll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you‚Äôll likely be able to answer other peoples‚Äô questions too. As a bonus, Slack allows you to format code to make it easy for all of us to copy and paste your code and distinguish it from the rest of your question.\n Use the forums Two of the most important sources for help with R-coding are StackOverflow (a Q\u0026amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and RStudio Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e.¬†you)). If you aren‚Äôt able to find an answer to your question from the thousands of existing questions, you can post your own. You‚Äôll need to create a reproducible example so others can figure out what you‚Äôre trying to do and what error you‚Äôre receiving, but you‚Äôd be amazed how helpful the community can be.\n Ask me! Sign up for a time to meet with me during student hours at https://calendly.com/mattwilliamson/. I‚Äôll want to know what searches you‚Äôve tried (so I don‚Äôt chase down answers that you‚Äôve already seen) and what approaches you‚Äôve tried and why they haven‚Äôt worked. Remember, I‚Äôm here to help (but not write your code for you).\n    Course materials R and RStudio R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure especially when dealing with spatial packages (we‚Äôll talk more about why this is during class). To make life easier, I have set up an online RStudio server service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won‚Äôt have to install anything on your computer and we should be able to avoid a number of the machine-specific issues that pop-up when 20 students have 20 different computers, operating systems (OS), etc. If you haven‚Äôt installed R on your local machine and would like some help getting that set up, there‚Äô a useful set of instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.\n  Course schedule This course is organized in 4 sections:\nData structures and using R as a Geographic Information System (GIS).\n Introduction to spatial datatypes used in R.\n Extracting, summarizing, and visualizing spatial data\n Common statistical analyses of spatial data\n  The schedule page provides an overview of what to expect each week.\nThis syllabus reflects a plan for the semester. Deviations may become necessary as the course progresses.\n Student Well-being If you are struggling for any reason (COVID, relationship, family, or life‚Äôs stresses) and believe these may impact your performance in the course, I encourage you to contact the Dean of Students at (208) 426-1527 or emaildeanofstundents@boisestate.edu for support. If you notice a significant change in your mood, sleep, feelings of hopelessness or a lack of self worth, consider connecting immediately with Counseling Services (1529 Belmont Street, Norco Building) at (208) 426-1459 or email healthservices@boisestate.edu.\n Assignments and grades You can find descriptions for all the assignments on the assignments page.\n   Assignment Points Percent    Exercises (14 √ó 15) 210 51%  Mini project 1 50 12%  Mini project 2 50 12%  Final project 100 24%  Total 410 ‚Äî        Grade Range Grade Range    A 90‚Äì100% D 60‚Äì69%  B 80‚Äì89% F \u0026lt; 60%  C 70‚Äì79%       Learning during a pandemic If you tell me you‚Äôre having trouble, I will not judge you or think less of you. I hope you‚Äôll extend me the same grace.\nYou never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical). You are always welcome to talk to me about things that you‚Äôre going through, though. If I can‚Äôt help you, I usually know somebody who can.\nIf you need extra help, or if you need more time with something, or if you feel like you‚Äôre behind or not understanding everything, do not suffer in silence! Talk to me! I will work with you. I promise.\n Late work With the exception of the mini projects and the final project, there‚Äôs no such late work. I would highly recommend staying caught up as much as possible, but if you need to turn something in late, that‚Äôs fine‚Äîthere‚Äôs no penalty.\n  This course was designed with you in mind I developed this course to provide a welcoming environment and effective, equitable learning experience for all students. If you encounter barriers in this course, please bring them to my attention so that I may work to address them.\nThis class‚Äôs community is inclusive. Students in this class represent a rich variety of backgrounds and perspectives. The Human-Environment Systems group is committed to providing an atmosphere for learning that respects diversity and creates inclusive environments in our courses. While working together to build this community, we ask all members to: * share their unique experiences, values, and beliefs, if comfortable doing so.\n listen deeply to one another.\n honor the uniqueness of their peers.\n appreciate the opportunity we have to learn from each other in this community.\n use this opportunity together to discuss ways in which we can create an inclusive environment in this course and across the campus community.\n recognize opportunities to invite a community member to exhibit more inclusive, equitable speech or behavior‚Äîand then also invite them into further conversation. We also expect community members to respond with gratitude and to take a moment of reflection when they receive such an invitation, rather than react immediately from defensiveness.\n keep confidential any discussions that the community has of a personal (or professional) nature, unless the speaker has given explicit permission to share what they have said.\n respect the right of students to be addressed and referred to by the names and pronouns that correspond to their gender identities, including the use of non-binary pronouns.\n   We use each other‚Äôs preferred names and pronouns. I will ask you to let me know your preferred or adopted name and gender pronoun(s), and I will make those changes to my own records and address you that way in all cases.\nTo change to a preferred name so that it displays on all BSU sites, including Canvas and our course roster, contact the Registrar‚Äôs Office at (208) 426-4249. Note that only a legal name change can alter your name on BSU official and legal documents (e.g., your transcript).\n This course is accessible to students with disabilities. I recognize that navigating your education and life can often be more difficult if you have disabilities. I want you to achieve at your highest capacity in this class. If you have a disability, I need to know if you encounter inequitable opportunities in my course related to:\n accessing and understanding course materials engaging with course materials and other students in the course\n demonstrating your skills and knowledge on assignments and exams.\n  If you have a documented disability, you may be eligible for accommodations in all of your courses. To learn more, make an appointment with the university‚Äôs Educational Access Center.\n For students responsible for children I recognize the unique challenges that can arise for students who are also parents or guardians of children. Any student needing to temporarily bring children or another dependent to class is welcome to do so to stay engaged with the class.\n  Academic Integrity Academic integrity is the principle that asks students to engage with their academic work to the fullest and to behave honestly, transparently, and ethically in every assignment and every interaction with a peer, professor, or research participant. When a strong culture of academic integrity is fostered by students and faculty in an academic program, students learn more, build positive relationships and collaborations, and can feel more confident in the value of their degrees.\nIn order to cultivate fairness and credibility, everyone must participate in upholding academic integrity. Students in this class are responsible for asking for help or clarification when it‚Äôs needed, speaking up when they see unethical behavior taking place, and understanding and adhering to the Student Code of Conduct, including the section on academic misconduct. Boise State and I take academic misconduct very seriously. It‚Äôs important to know that when a student engages in academic misconduct, I will report the incident to the Office of the Dean of Students. I also have the right to assign sanctions, which could include requirements to revise or redo work, complete educational assignments to learn about academic integrity, and grade penalties ranging from lower credit on an assignment to failing this class1. Students should learn more by reviewing the Student Code of Conduct.\n  So seriously, just don‚Äôt cheat or plagiarize!‚Ü©Ô∏é\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e4d5a4a79239f08c6ad0d7cbf1be756c","permalink":"http://isdrfall21.classes.spaseslab.com/syllabus/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/syllabus/","section":"","summary":"Course Description Course Objectives Expectations Prerequisite Knowledge and Skills  Getting help with R problems  Course materials  R and RStudio  Course schedule Student Well-being Assignments and grades  Learning during a pandemic Late work  This course was designed with you in mind  This class‚Äôs community is inclusive.","tags":null,"title":"Syllabus","type":"page"}]
