# Plan for today

*   Revisiting story structures

*   Telling stories with data

*   `flexdashboards` and telling stories with `R`

*   `shiny` and increasing the power of your stories

# Common story forms

- Opening &rightarrow; Challenge &rightarrow; Action &rightarrow; Resolution

> "Let me tell you a story about the theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking. He was diagnosed with motor neuron disease at age 21—one year into his PhD—and was given two years to live. Hawking did not accept this predicament and started pouring all his energy into doing science. Hawking ended up living to be 76, became one of the most influential physicists of his time, and did all of his seminal work while being severely disabled."

- They are also aesthetic objects that can engage broader audiences

# Telling stories with `flexdashboards`

.pull-left[
- __Dashboard__: a visual display of interrelated data

- `flexdashboards` are an `Rmarkdown`-powered way to build dashboards

- Integrates with `plotly`, `leaflet` and other `htmlwidgets`

- [Examples](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/articles/examples.html)

# Telling stories with `flexdashboards`

- Audience engagement drives design

- "Scrolling" layouts allow linear story telling (like the ArcGIS Storymap)

- ["Tabset"](https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/jjallaire/htmlwidgets-ggplotly-geoms/htmlwidgets-ggplotly-geoms.html#geom_point) layouts allow users to construct their own stories

- Lots of readymade templates, themes, and add-ins

- Display your [research](https://ryanpeek.org/flexdash_rabo.html#maps)

name: shiny
class: center middle main-title section-title-4

# Introduction to `shiny`

---

# What is `shiny`

- An `Rstudio` product designed to allow reactive data visualizations via an R server

- Allows users to generate new results (not just plot your old stuff)



---

# The simplest `shiny` app

```{r simpshiny}
library(shiny)

server <- function(input, output, session) { } #the server

ui <- basicPage("This is a real Shiny app") # the user interface

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server) # this launches your app
```

---

# Reactivity

- Flexdashboards allow the user to visualized data you've created

- Integrating `shiny` apps allows them to run new analysis!

- [Examples](https://jjallaire.shinyapps.io/shiny-kmeans/)

- Reactivity is the link between user input and server output

---
# Reactivity
.pull-left[
```{r shinyreac}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
  observe({
    # even though the slider is not involved in a calculation, if
    # you change the slider it will run all this code and update the text box
    # changes to the mytext box also will trigger the code to run
    input$myslider
    txt <- paste(input$mytext, sample(1:10000, 1))
    updateTextInput(session, inputId = "myresults", value = txt)  
    
  })
  
}

ui <- basicPage(
  h3("The results text box gets updated if you change the other text box OR the slider."),
  sliderInput("myslider", "A slider:", min=0, max=1000, value=500),
  textInput("mytext", "Input goes here", value = "Initial value"),
  textInput("myresults", "Results will be printed here")
)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r shinyview}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
