> "Let me tell you a story about the theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking. He was diagnosed with motor neuron disease at age 21—one year into his PhD—and was given two years to live. Hawking did not accept this predicament and started pouring all his energy into doing science. Hawking ended up living to be 76, became one of the most influential physicists of his time, and did all of his seminal work while being severely disabled."
