# Why Not R?

Coding can be hard...

Memory challenges

--

Speed

Decision fatigue

# Logistics

- Tuesdays - generally a lecture with some live coding demonstrations
- Thursdays - "lab" to work through the example, work on the assignments, get help
- [Course Webpage](http://isdrfall21.classes.spaseslab.com/)
- Class during COVID

# R, RStudio, and Git

- We'll use RStudio server to minimize setup troubleshooting (you should still have R on your machine)

- Data, code, and assignments managed via GitHub classroom (we'll go through all of this on Thurs)

- This is going to be a team effort!! (check out the [Resources](/resource/) for info on getting started)

# Data types and structures in R

  - R has 6 basic data types

--
    - character, numeric, integer, logical, and complex
--
  - R has __A LOT__ of different data structures

--
    - vectors, data frames, tibbles, lists, and matrices
--
  - R even has special object types

--
    - stanfit, grobs, lm
--
  - Knowing the kind of data and structure it's in helps guide coding
  
  - Spatial data often in lists, matrices, tibbles, and special objects
  
  - We'll explore the implications of different data structures for accessing, modifying, and plotting in our first lab

# Parting Thoughts
- Am I making a map or running an analysis
- What is the goal of my analysis or figure?
- Is the spatial arrangement important?

---
# Before next time
- Sign up for github (and send me your username)
- Enter your seat number in my.boisestate.edu
- Verify that you are able to login to the RStudio server with the VPN
