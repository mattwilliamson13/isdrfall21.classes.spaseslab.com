# Goals for today

* Describe the general analysis situation for event distribution models

* Introduce common data structures and analyses for distribution models

* Discuss inferential limitations for different model types

# Motivations
---
# Why do we create distribution models?
.pull-left[

* To identify important correlations between predictors and the occurrence of an event

* To generate maps of the 'range' or 'niche' of events

* To understand spatial patterns of event co-occurrence

* To forecast changes in event distributions due to changes in those predictors

* A matrix of predictors $(\mathbf{X})$ that can be assigned to each event based on spatial location

* Additional (non-spatial) predictors $(\mathbf{Z})$ may describe the sampling process

* __Goal__: Estimate the probability of occurrence of events across unsampled regions of the study area based on correlations with predictors

# Logistic regression
.pull-left[
* When we have presences and absences across the study area we can model the __probability__ of occurrence using a logistic regression:

$$ y_{i} \sim \text{Bern}(p_i)\\
\text{link}(p_i) = \mathbf{x_i}'\beta + \alpha
$$
* A _link_ function is used to map the linear predictor $(\mathbf{x_i}'\beta + \alpha)$ onto the support (0-1) for probabilities

* Most `R` modelling packages use the logit link $ln\big(\frac{p}{1-p}\big)$ as the default; interpreted as the _log-odds_

* Estimates of $\beta$ can then be used to generate 'wall-to-wall' spatial predictions

# Key assumptions of logistic regression

* Dependent variable must be binary

* Observations must be independent (important for spatial analyses)

* Predictors should not be collinear

* Predictors should be linearly related to the log-odds

* __Sample Size__

# Alternatives to logistic regression
.pull-left[
* Classification and regression trees

* Random Forests

* Support-Vector Machines

* Artifical Neural Nets

# Maximum Entropy models
.pull-left[
* Commonly referred to as MaxEnt (after the original software)

* Relies on the generation of _plausible_ background points across the remainder of the study area

* Iterative fitting to maximize the distance between predictions generated by a spatially uniform model 

* Tuning parameters to account for differences in sampling effort, placement of background points, etc

* Development of the model beyond the scope of this course, but see [Elith et al. 2010](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/maxent_explained.pdf)

# Challenges with MaxEnt

* Not measuring _probability_, but relative likelihood of occurrence

* Sampling bias affects estimation (but can be mitigated using tuning parameters)

* Theoretical issues with background points and the intercept

* Recent developments relate MaxEnt (with cloglog links) to Inhomogenous Point Process models

* The presence (or absence) of the event is recorded for each point

* Hypothesized predictors of occurrence are measured (or extracted) at each point 

* Imperfect detection makes _absences_ __ambiguous__

* Repeated measurements at the same location can help (time vs. space)

# Parting thoughts

* This is a _very_ brief (and rushed) introduction, lots of literature and new developments

* None of these models may be any good (we'll look at that on Thurs and Mon)

* Bayesian extensions; applications with telemetry; changes through time
