# Clarity in presentation

- Zooming allows the user to determine scale of presentation

- Hovering allows more information to be displayed 'on-demand'

- Subsetting facilitates ease of interpretation

# Telling a story

- Order of information can evoke emotional connections

- That reaction helps make your analysis memorable

- Feedback is critical

- Ideation: What _specifically_ does the user need?

- Meaning: Are the data clearly defined and explained? Are the conclusions obvious?

- Function: Given the usecases, will the application (visualization) actually perform?

# Building interactive visualizations in R

# A note about APIs

- API: Application Programming Interface

- A software intermediary that allows two applications to "communicate"

- Lots of `R` packages rely on APIs to access data on the web (e.g.,`tidycensus`)

- Facilitates reproducibility and powerful web applications built on `R` analyses

- May require "keys" and addtional parsing (Mapbox and Google)

---

# Interactive maps with `tmap`

- Easy extension of your existing `tmap` skills
```{r tmim, eval=FALSE}
map_nz1 =  tm_shape(nz) + tm_polygons()
tmap_mode("view")
map_nz1
```
