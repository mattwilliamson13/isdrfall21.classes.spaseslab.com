# Goals for today

* Define point patterns and their utility spatial analysis

* Introduce methods for describing point patterns

* Describe several commmon methods for the statistical analysis of point patterns 
---
# What is a point pattern?

.pull-left[

* _Point pattern_: A __set__ of __events__ eithin a study region (i.e., a _window_)

* __Set__: A collection of mathematical __events__

* __Events__: The existence of a point object of the type we are interested in at a particular location in the study region

* A _marked point pattern_ refers to a point pattern where the events have additional descriptors
]
.pull-right[
__Some notation:__

* $S$: refers to the entire set

* $\mathbf{s_i}$ denotes the vector of data describing point $s_i$ in set $S$

* $\#(S \in A )$ refers to the number of points in $S$ within study area $A$
]
---
# Requirements for a set to be considered a point pattern

* The pattern must be mapped on a plane to preserve distance

* The study area, $A$, should be objectively determined

* There should be a $1:1$ correspondence between objects in $A$ and events in the pattern

* Events must be _proper_ i.e., refer to actual locations of the event

* For some analyses the pattern should be a census of the relevant events

# Describing point patterns

.pull-left[

* _Density-based metrics_: the $\#$ of points within area, $a$, in study area $A$

* _Distance-based metrics_: based on nearest neighbor distances or the distance matrix for all points

* _First order_ effects reflect variation in __intensity__ due to variation in the 'attractiveness' of locations

* _Second order_ effects reflect variation in __intensity__ due to the presence of points themselves

op <- par(no.readonly = TRUE) 
nclust <- function(x0, y0, radius, n) {
              return(runifdisc(n, radius, centre=c(x0, y0)))
            }
x <- rpoispp(lambda =50)

```
]

# Centrography
.pull-left[
* _Mean center_: the point, $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$, whose coordinates are the average of all events in the pattern
* _Standard distance_: a measure of the dispersion of points around the _mean center_
* _Standard ellipse_: dispersion in one dimension

# Density based methods
.pull-left[
* The overall _intensity_ of a point pattern is a crude density estimate
$$\hat{\lambda} = \frac{\#(S \in A )}{a}$$
* Local density = quadrat counts
]
.pull-right[
```{r qct, echo=FALSE}
Q = quadratcount(x)
plot(x, main="")
plot(Q, add=TRUE)
```
]
---
# Density based methods
.pull-left[
* __kernel density estimates__: similar to quadrat counts, but using a _moving window_ for the subregion

* __kernel__: defines the shape, size, and weight assigned to observations in the window

* weights often assigned based on distance from the window center
]
.pull-right[
```{r krn, echo=FALSE}
K1 <- density(x, bw=2)
K2 <- density(x, bw=0.005)# Using the default bandwidth
op <- par(no.readonly = TRUE) 
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(K1, main=NULL, las=1)
contour(K1, add=TRUE)
plot(K2, main=NULL, las=1)
contour(K2, add=TRUE)
par(op)
```
]
---
# Distance based metrics
.pull-left[
* Provide an estimate of the _second order_ effects

* _Mean nearest-neighbor distance_:
$$\hat{d_{min}} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{m} d_{min}(\mathbf{s_i})}{n}$$

* _G_ function: the cummulative frequency distribution of the nearest neighbor distances

* _F_ function: similar to _G_ but based on randomly located points

* Clustering with _G_
]
.pull-right[
```{r cumdist, echo=FALSE}
ANN <- apply(nndist(x, k=1:50),2,FUN=mean)
plot(ANN ~ eval(1:50), type="b", main=NULL, las=1)
```
]

# Distance based metrics

.pull-left[
* Nearest neighbor methods throw away a lot of information

* The _K_ function is an alternative, based on a series of circles with increasing radius
]
.pull-right[
```{r Kfun, echo=FALSE}
K <- Kest(x)
plot(K, main=NULL, las=1, legendargs=list(cex=0.8, xpd=TRUE, inset=c(0.9, 0) ))

# Statistical analysis of point patterns
---
# Simple tests

* Distributional assumptions and heuristics
---
# Expected Values

* We can use the $\chi^{2}$ distribution to compare an observed point pattern to one generated by an expectation

* Often CSR is not interesting so we can use _Monte Carlo Methods_ to generate custom expectations

* We'll do this on Thursday

---
# Estimating the parameters of covariate effects

* Often we are more interested in the effects of specific covariates on the resulting pattern

* Spatial regression models

* These are the foundation of "event distribution models"

* More on these after break
