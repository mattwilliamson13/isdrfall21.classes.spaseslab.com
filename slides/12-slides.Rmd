# Today's objectives

* Introduce the concept of spatial patterns as realizations of _spatial processes_

* Demonstrate the use of expected values for evaluating a hypothesized process

* Introduce measures for characterizing spatial patterns

* Explore the concept of __scale__ and its implications for understanding spatial processes

# Patterns as realizations of spatial processes

* A __spatial process__ is a description of how a spatial pattern might be _generated_

* __Generative models__ 

* An observed pattern as a _possible realization_ of an hypothesized process

# Deterministic vs. stochastic processes

* Deterministic processes: always produces the same outcome

$$
z = 2x + 3y
$$
* Results in a spatially continuous field

# Deterministic vs. stochastic processes

.pull-left[

* Stochastic processes: variation makes each realization difficult to predict

$$
z = 2x + 3y + d
$$
* The _process_ is random, not the result (!!)
* Measurement error makes deterministic processes appear stochastic

# Expected values and hypothesis testing

.pull-left[
* Considering each outcome as the realization of a process allows us to generate expected values

* The simplest spatial process is Completely Spatial Random (CSR) process

* __First Order__ effects: any event has an equal probability of occuring in a location

* __Second Order__ effects: the location of one event is independent of the other events

* We can use quadrat counts to estimate the expected number of events in a given area

* The probability of each possible count is given by:
$$
P(n,k) = {n \choose x}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
$$

* This becomes computationally exhausting...
