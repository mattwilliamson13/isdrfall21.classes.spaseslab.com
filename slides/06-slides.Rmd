- Planning an analysis

- Databases and attributes

- Building a database for an analysis (part 1)

- The process of turning maps into information


- Any- or everything we do with GIS

- ESRI Dictionary: "The process of examining the locations, attributes, and relationships of features in spatial data through overlay and other analytical techniques in order to address a question or gain useful knowledge. Spatial analysis extracts or creates new information from spatial data".

- The use of computational and statistical algorithms to understand the relations between things that co-occur in space.

# Common pitfalls of spatial analysis

- __Locational Fallacy:__ Error due to the spatial characterization chosen for elements of study


- __Atomic Fallacy:__ Applying conclusions from individuals to entire spatial units


- __Ecological Fallacy:__ Applying conclusions from aggregated information to individuals




> Spatial analysis is an inherently complex endeavor and one that is advancing rapidly. So-called "best practices" for addressing many of these issues are still being developed and debated. This doesn't mean you shouldn't do spatial analysis, but you should keep these things in mind as you design, implement, and interpret your analyses

- Previous focus has been largely on _location_

- Geographic data often also includes non-spatial data

- Attributes: Non-spatial information that further describes a spatial feature

- Typically stored in tables where each row represents a spatial feature
  - Wide vs. long format

# Common attribute operations

- `sf` is a part of the `tidyverse`

- Allows use of `dplyr` data manipulation verbs 

- Also allows `%>%` to chain together multiple steps

- geometries are "sticky"
